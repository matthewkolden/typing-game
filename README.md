# The Typing Game
This game was built as a project for my General Assembly SEI Class and a fun way to test myself (and others) on their typing speed. Your words per minute will be tracked along as you play, so try to get the highest score you can.
## Instructions
Once you hit the start button, your quote will appear above the text box and the timer will start counting down. Finish typing the quote within the alloted time and you will be rewarded with stars! Collect three stars and move on to the next level. The amount of time provided will decrease with each level, so watch out!
